== Description ==

The purpose of the Barcode Letter-Size plugin is to create barcodes to identify/match your products. So when you do your 
inventory, you can check to see how many products you have in stock on the website and compare what you actually have in your 
storage or warehouse. This will help you keep track the actual number of products you have in stock and then you will update the 
actual numbers on the website. Most likely you have to create an excel sheet that has your products, sku, prices and the number 
in stock so you can keep track monthly.
